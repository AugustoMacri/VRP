# Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)

Welcome to the Vehicle Routing Problem repository for my Scientific Initiation project.

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to solving the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) using Genetic Algorithm. The VRP is a classic problem in the field of operations research and optimization, aiming to optimize the routes of vehicles to deliver packeges or services to a set of customers while minimizing costs or maximizing efficiency.

## Current Status

This project is currently in progress. I am developing a Genetic Algorithm in the C programming language.
